"The mlab plotting functions take numpy arrays as input, describing the "
"``x``, ``y``, and ``z`` coordinates of the data. They build full-blown "
"visualizations: they create the data source, filters if necessary, and add "
"the visualization modules. Their behavior, and thus the visualization "
"created, can be fine-tuned through keyword arguments, similarly to pylab. In"
" addition, they all return the visualization module created, thus "
"visualization can also be modified by changing the attributes of this "
"module."

"the connectivity is not regular, but is not known in advance either. The "
"data points lie on a surface, and we want to plot the surface implicitly "
