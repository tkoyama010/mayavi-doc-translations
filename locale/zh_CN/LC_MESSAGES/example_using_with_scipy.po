"This tutorial example shows you how you can use Mayavi interactively to "
"visualize `numpy`_ arrays while doing numerical work with `scipy`_. It "
"assumes that you are familiar with numerical Python tools, and shows you how"
" to use Mayavi in combination with these tools."

"Let us study the trajectories of a particle in a potential. This is a very "
"common problem in physics and engineering, and visualization of the "
"potential and the trajectories is key to developing an understanding of the "
"problem."

"The potential we are interested is a periodic lattice, immersed in a "
"parabolic confinement. We will shake this potential and see how the particle"
" jumps from a hole of the lattice to another. The parabolic confinement is "
"there to limit the excursions of the particle::"

"Now that we have defined the potential, we would like to see what it looks "
"like in 3D. To do this we can create a 3D grid of points, and sample it on "
"these points::"

"We are going to use the `mlab` module (see :ref:`simple-scripting-with-"
"mlab`) to interactively visualize this volumetric data. For this it is best "
"to type the commands in an interactive Python shell, either using the built-"
"in shell of the Mayavi2 application, on in `ipython --gui=qt`. Let us "
"visualize the 3D isosurfaces of the potential::"

"We can interact with the visualization created by the above command by "
"rotating the view, but to get a good understanding of the structure of the "
"potential, it is useful to vary the iso-surfaces. We can do this by double-"
"clicking on the `IsoSurface` in the Mayavi pipeline tree (if you are running"
" from `ipython`, you need to click on the Mayavi icon on the scene to pop up"
" the pipeline). This opens a dialog which lets us select the values of the "
"contours used. A good view of the potential can be achieved by turning off "
"auto contours and choosing -0.5 as a first contour value (eg by entering it "
"in the text box on the right, and pressing `tab`). A second contour can be "
"added by clicking on the blue arrow and selecting \"Add after\". Using a "
"value of 15 gives a nice result."

"'Paired' as it separates well levels."

"To get a better view of the potential, we would like to display more "
"contours, but the problem with this approach is that closed contours hide "
"their interior. On solution is to use a cut plane. Right-click on the "
"`IsoSurface` node and add a `ScalarCutPlane` through the \"Add module\" sub "
"menu. You can move the cut plane by clicking on it and dragging."

"To make the link between our numpy arrays and the visualization, we can use "
"the same menu to add an Axes and an Outline. Finally, let us add a colorbar."

"We want to study the motion of a particle in this potential. For this we "
"need to derive the corresponding force, given by the gradient of the "
"potential. We create a gradient function::"

"To check that our gradient function works well, let us visualize the vector "

"Now we can use `scipy` to integrate the trajectories. We first have to "
"define a dynamical flow, the function that returns the derivative of the "
"different parameters as a function of these parameters and of time. The flow"
" is used by every ODE_ (ordinary differential equation) solver, it give the "
"dynamic of the system. The dynamics we are interested in is made of the "
"force deriving from the potential, which we shake with time in the three "
"directions, as well as a damping force. The damping coefficient and the "
"amount and frequency of shaking have been tuned to give an interesting "
"dynamic. ::"

"`Colors and legends` node. We plot the trajectories with extra scalar "
"information attached to it, to display the time via the colormap::"
