"The Known Issues section contains those items that are big and important but"
" are not currently actively worked on, because they need a lot of effort or "
"there is no solution yet for them. For a more detailed list of issues and "
"bugs please check the list in `issue tracker`_."

"**Display bugs:** Mayavi, and VTK, heavily use hardware rendering, as a "
"result are very sensitive to hardware rendering bugs. Common issues include "
"surfaces showing up as black instead of colored (mostly on windows or in "
"virtual machines, I believe), z-ordering bugs where hidden triangles are "
"displayed in front of the triangles that should hide them (a common bug on "
"Linux with intel graphics cards), or the rendering windows becoming grey "
"when the focus is moved out (often seen on Linux, when compiz is enabled). "
"The solution is most often simply to turn off hardware rendering in the "
"system settings (turn off compiz under Linux) or change graphics-card "
"drivers (under Linux, try switching between the open source one, and the "
"proprietary one)."

"**Qt 5:** Mayavi is built on top of the traitsui and pyface gui libraries. "
"Thus support for Qt 5 is linked to these gui libraries supporting Qt 5."

"**wxPython 3:** Similar to the Qt 5 issue support for wxPython 3 is linked "
"with the necessary support arriving in the stable releases of the gui "
"libraries."
