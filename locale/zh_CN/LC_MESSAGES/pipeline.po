"Mayavi uses `VTK <http://www.vtk.org>`_ for all its visualization needs. A "
"pipeline concept underlies all the visualization in VTK. However, it is "
"important to note that the pipeline used by Mayavi does not correspond to "
"the VTK pipeline creating the visualization: the layout is different, the "
"objects are not the same, and there are more nodes in a VTK pipeline. The "
"two pipelines share some similarities, but in this section, we are only "
"concerned by the Mayavi pipeline."
