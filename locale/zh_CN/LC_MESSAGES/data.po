"Describing data in three dimensions in the general case is a complex "
"problem. Mayavi helps you focus on your visualization work and not worry too"
" much about the underlying data structures, for instance using mlab (see "
":ref:`simple-scripting-with-mlab`). We suggest you create sources for Mayavi"
" using `mlab` or Mayavi sources when possible. However, it helps to "
"understand the VTK data structures that Mayavi uses if you want to create "
