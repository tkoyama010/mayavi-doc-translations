"interactively`. It is often impossible to choose the best parameters for a "
"visualization before hand. Colors, contour values, colormap, view angle, "

"Moreover, the `mlab` functions expose only a small fraction of the "

" are built from VTK objects. It can be hard to find the right attribute to "
"modify when exploring them, or in the VTK documentation, thus the easiest "
"way is to modify them interactively using the pipeline view dialog and use "
"the :ref:`record feature <record_feature>` to find out the corresponding "
"lines of code. See :ref:`organisation_mayavi_visualisations` to understand "
"better the link between the lines of code generated by the record feature "
